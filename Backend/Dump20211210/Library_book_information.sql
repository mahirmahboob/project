All that the guests have in common is a wicked past they\'re unwilling to reveal—and a secret that will seal their fate. For each has been marked for murder. A famous nursery rhyme is framed and hung in every room of the mansion:  \"Ten little boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine. Nine little boys sat up very late; One overslept himself and then there were eight. Eight little boys traveling in Devon; One said he\'d stay there then there were seven.

One little boy left all alone; He went out and hanged himself and then there were none.\"  When they realize that murders are occurring as described in the rhyme, terror mounts.

The author was an anonymous Anglo-Saxon poet, referred to by scholars as the \"Beowulf poet\". The poem is set in Scandinavia. Beowulf, a hero of the Geats, comes to the aid of Hrothgar, the king of the Danes, whose mead hall in Heorot has been under attack by a monster known as Grendel. After Beowulf slays him, Grendel\'s mother attacks the hall and is then also defeated. Victorious, Beowulf goes home to Geatland and later becomes king of the Geats.

He shared the magic of those meals with us in The Tucci Cookbook and The Tucci Table, and now he takes us beyond the recipes and into the stories behind them.\n\nTaste is a reflection on the intersection of food and life, filled with anecdotes about growing up in Westchester, New York, preparing for and filming the foodie films Big Night and Julie & Julia, falling in love over dinner, and teaming up with his wife to create conversation-starting meals for their children. Each morsel of this gastronomic journey through good times and bad, five-star meals and burnt dishes, is as heartfelt and delicious as the last.\n\nWritten with Stanley\'s signature wry humour and nostalgia, Taste is a heartwarming read that will be irresistible for anyone who knows the power of a home-cooked meal.'),('The Adventures of Tom Sawyer','adventure','Mark Twain',70,'teens',184,2008,'death','Yes','No','https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1404811979l/24583.jpg','https://www.goodreads.com/buy_buttons/12/follow?book_id=24583&page_type=book&page_type_id=24583&ref=x_gr_w_bb_glide_sin&sub_page_type=show&tag=x_gr_w_bb_glide_sin-20','he Adventures of Tom Sawyer revolves around the youthful adventures of the novel\'s schoolboy protagonist, Thomas Sawyer, whose reputation precedes him for causing mischief and strife. Tom lives with his Aunt Polly, half-brother Sid, and cousin Mary in the quaint town of St. Petersburg, just off the shore of the Mississippi River. St. Petersburg is described as a typical small-town atmosphere where the Christian faith is predominant, the social network is close-knit, and familiarity resides.\n\nUnlike his brother Sid, Tom receives \"lickings\" from his Aunt Polly; ever the mischief-maker, would rather play hooky than attend school and often sneaks out his bedroom window at night to adventure with his friend, Huckleberry Finn ­ the town\'s social outcast. Tom, despite his dread of schooling, is extremely clever and would normally get away with his pranks if Sid were not such a \"tattle-tale.\"\n\nAs punishment for skipping school to go swimming, Aunt Polly assigns Tom the chore of whitewashing the fence surrounding the house. In a brilliant scheme, Tom is able to con the neighborhood boys into completing the chore for him, managing to convince them of the joys of whitewashing. At school, Tom is equally as flamboyant, and attracts attention by chasing other boys, yelling, and running around. With his usual antics, Tom attempts to catch the eye of Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town, and persuades her to get \"engaged\" by kissing him. But their romance collapses when she learns Tom has been \"engaged\" previously to Amy Lawrence. Shortly after Becky shuns him, he accompanies Huckleberry Finn to the graveyard at night, where they witness the murder of Dr. Robinson.'),('The Bride','romance','Julia Garwood',67,'all',368,2002,'Animal Cruelty','No','No','https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81ICKx7RGsL.jpg','https://www.amazon.com/Bride-Julie-Garwood/dp/0671737791','It’s a romantic novel about a mismatched young wife and husband who, despite their differences in background and temperament, fall inexorably in love'),('The Bride Test','adventure','Helen Hoang',91,'all',320,2019,'vampire','No','Yes','https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81RlXlaVRrL.jpg','https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-bride-test-helen-hoang/1128615823?ean=9780451490827','Khai Diep has no feelings. Well, he feels irritation when people move his things or contentment when ledgers balance down to the penny, but not big, important emotions—like grief. And love. He thinks he’s defective.

The Knight, the Miller, the Friar, the Squire, the Prioress, the Wife of Bath, and others who make up the cast of characters -- including Chaucer himself -- are real people, with human emotions and weaknesses. When it is remembered that Chaucer wrote in English at a time when Latin was the standard literary language across western Europe, the magnitude of his achievement is even more remarkable. But Chaucer\'s genius needs no historical introduction; it bursts forth from every page of The Canterbury Tales.\n\nIf we trust the General Prologue, Chaucer intended that each pilgrim should tell two tales on the way to Canterbury and two tales on the way back. He never finished his enormous project and even the completed tales were not finally revised. Scholars are uncertain about the order of the tales. As the printing press had yet to be invented when Chaucer wrote his works, The Canterbury Tales has been passed down in several handwritten manuscripts.'),('The Fairy-Tale Detectives','fantasy',' Michael Buckley',74,'child',128,1991,'death','No','Yes','https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349272153l/176327.jpg','https://www.goodreads.com/buy_buttons/12/follow?book_id=176327&page_type=book&page_type_id=176327&ref=x_gr_w_bb_glide_sin&sub_page_type=show&tag=x_gr_w_bb_glide_sin-20','For Sabrina and Daphne Grimm, life has not been a fairy tale.

Combining the skills of a poet and scholar, Robert Fagles brings the energy of contemporary language to this enduring heroic epic.\n\nIf \'The Iliad\' is the world\'s greatest war story, then \'The Odyssey\' is literature\'s greatest evocation of every man\'s journey through life. Here again, Fagles has performed the translator\'s task magnificently, giving us an Odyssey to read aloud, to savor, and to treasure for its sheer lyrical mastery.\n\nEach volume contains a superb introduction with textual and critical commentary by renowned classicist Bernard Knox.'),('The Kiss Quotient','romance','Helen Hoang',39,'all',323,2018,'No trigger warning','No','Yes','https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81TaR7kzn7L.jpg','https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-kiss-quotient-helen-hoang/1127085542?ean=9780451490803','Stella Lane thinks math is the only thing that unites the universe.

Abby knows it\'s a big no-no to fall for a colleague.

From the moment young Jim Hawkins first encounters the sinister Blind Pew at the Admiral Benbow Inn until the climactic battle for treasure on a tropic isle, the novel creates scenes and characters that have fired the imaginations of generations of readers. Written by a superb prose stylist, a master of both action and atmosphere, the story centers upon the conflict between good and evil - but in this case a particularly engaging form of evil. It is the villainy of that most ambiguous rogue Long John Silver that sets the tempo of this tale of treachery, greed, and daring. Designed to forever kindle a dream of high romance and distant horizons, Treasure Island is, in the words of G. K. Chesterton, \'the realization of an ideal, that which is promised in its provocative and beckoning map; a vision not only of white skeletons but also green palm trees and sapphire seas.\' G. S. Fraser terms it \'an utterly original book\' and goes on to write: \'There will always be a place for stories like Treasure Island that can keep boys and old men happy.\''),('Tricks','fantasy','Ellen Hopkins',89,'all',640,2009,'suicide','No','Yes','https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347236052l/5510384.jpg','https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/tricks-ellen-hopkins/1100329511?ean=9781481498241','Five teenagers from different parts of the country.
